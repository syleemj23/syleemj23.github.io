Deletion of Files
: When a file is deleted, the file is marked as deleted on the file system of the digital media that contains the file.
  This means that the actual contents of the file exist until the space of the digital media that the file contents occupy is overwritten with other data.
  As a result, a possibility exists that a deleted file could be recovered.<br><br>

Formatting a Digital Media
: When digital media is formatted, its file system table is re-created.
  This means that the files stored on the digital media exist until their respective occupying spaces on the digital media are overwritten with other data.
  As a result, a possibility exists that the files stored on the previous file system table could be recovered.<br>
  (The explanation of the different types of formats needs to be added, such as low formats)<br><br>

Wiping a Digital Media
: When digital media is wiped, it is overwritten with arbitrary data, such as 0 or 1, so it is almost impossible to recover pre-existing data on the digital media.
  This technique is used in sanitizing digital media that will be used for data collection.
