description: Types of digital evidence from 2 different perspectives
---

According to the National Institute of Justice, digital evidence is the information stored or transmitted in binary form that may be relied on in court. It can be seen from two different perspectives, its role against suspects and the types of information from it. 

From the perspective of the role of digital against suspects, it can be 2 types, exculpatory evidence and inculpatory evidence. Exculpatory evidence proves the innocence of suspects while inculpatory evidence proves the guilty.

From the perspective of the types of information, it can show 2 types of information, class characteristics and individual characteristics. Class characteristics show common traits. For example, most latest versions of Windows use NTFS as the default file system, so when one finds a permanent storage media with NTFS, he or she may presume that the machine associated with the storage media could be a Windows machine. From this example, NTFS can be seen as a class characteristic of Windows. On the other hand, individual characteristics show unique identifiable traits. For instance, a machine on a network uses a unique IP address during a specific duration to communicate with other machines on the network. Consequently, when an IP address surfaces as a new piece of evidence associated with a crime, one can find the machine related to the IP address. In this example, an IP address can be considered an individual characteristic of a machine.
