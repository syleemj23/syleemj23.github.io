### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
* Track
  : A track is a concentric band and consists of multiple sectors.
* Sector
  : A sector is the unit in which a track is uniformly separated.
  : A sector is the smallest storage unit physically addressable.
  : The typical size of a sector is 512 bytes.
* Cluster
  : A cluster consists of multiple sectors.
  : A cluster is the smallest storage unit logically addressable, so even a file in the smaller size than a cluster needs to occupy a cluster.
  : A cluster typically consists of 8 sectors of 512 bytes, so its typical size is 4096 bytes.
  : Access to HDD in the unit of cluster reduces the number of access to hdd than that in the unit of sector.

### Solid State Drive (SSD)
* Cell
  : A cell is the storage unit where one or more bits are stored.
  : Depending on how many bits are stored in a cell, the cell is called SLC (Single Level Cell) with the one bit storage, MLC (Multi Level Cell) with the two bit storage, and TLC (Triple Level Cell) with the three bit storage.
* Page
  : A page consists of multiple cells.
  : A page is the smallest storage unit.
* Block
  : A block consists of multiple blocks
  : A block is the smallest erasing unit.
* Garbage Collection
  : Garbage collection is the process of copying the data in valid pages of a block to another block and erasing all the pages in the original block.
  : When some pages in a block become invalid, such as through the logical-level deletion of data in the pages, these pages cannot be re-used until all the pages in the block are erased through garbage collection.
* Wear Leveling
  : Wear leveling is the process of storing data into the cell with fewer number of writing operations.
  : The life span of a cell becomes shorten with more writing operations occurring on the cell, so wear leveing is performed to extend the life span of cells.
  : Wear leveing could introduce different hash values with the same data on a SSD.
