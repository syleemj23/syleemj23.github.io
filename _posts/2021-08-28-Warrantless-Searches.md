&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followings are the cases where law enforcement (LE) can perform searches without warrants, but whether it is allowed to inspect the contents of a device is another consideration.
* Consent
  : This is when an owner has given a permission.
  : Inspecting the contents of a device might be possible depending on given permissions.
  * Requirements for Valid Consent
    : 1) Voluntary
    : 2) Given by the actual owner of a device or its apparent authority. <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If a device is shared, then, its other users than the owner could be its authority.)
  * **Types of Consents**
    * Owners' Consent
    * 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Consent under 3<sup>rd</sup> Party's Joint Access or Control <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ex) Shipping Companies can give a consent to their packages
    * Implied Consent by Banners <br />
  * Scope of Search
    : Scope is strictly restricted by the terms and plain meaning of a consent.

* Exigent Circumstances
  : These are when a reasonable person believes that the time needed to obtain search warrants can cause 1) physical harms to people, 2) destruction of evidence, 3) escape of suspects, or 4) consequences of frustrating LE's efforts.
  * Considerations
    : 1) Degree of urgency
    : 2) Amount of time needed to obtain a warrant
    : 3) Degree of the possibility where evidence can be removed or destroyed
    : 4) Danger at the site
* Plain View
  : This is when evidence is visible to LE.
  * Considerations
    : 1) This exception can be relied on only by LE.
    : 2) The clear visibility of evidence should be apparent.
* Search Incident to Arrest (SIA)
  : This is a search performed when a person is arrested.
  * Requirements
    : 1) Lawful custodial arrest should take place.
    : 2) Search should be performed contemporaneous with its associated arrest.
  * Scope of Search
    : 1) Arrested person
    : 2) The areas under the person's immediate control for weapons, means of escape, and evidence of a crime.
* Inventory Search
  : This is the searches performed on impounded items by LE to record their physical contents
  : This exception is hard to be applied to inspect the contents of a device.
  * Purposes for recoring the physical contents of impounded items
    : 1) To protect the impounded items
    : 2) To protect LE and its properties
    : 3) To protect against claims over lost or stolen items
