&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmund Locard said that it is impossible for a criminal to act without leaving traces of this presence, especially considering the intensity of a crime.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, this principle says that an action result in evidence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This principle works in not only physical but also digital worlds.
