Welcome to my homepage.

I am Sangyeon Lee from the Republic of Korea and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Digital Forensics at George Mason University. 

As one of my backgrounds is Computer Science, one of my interests is to develop computer forensic tools. 

I maintain both my projects and my learning through this homepage. 

Please contact me through one of the contact methods below for either my resume or any question.
