# **About Me**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently studying Digital Forensics at George Mason University. <br />
Previously, I majored in Computer Science at Oregon State University, so one interest associated with the current field is to develop Digital Forensic tools with my programming skills. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I think that the best knowledge comes when theoretical knowledge is combined with practical one, I always try hard to understand the logic behind a skill.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information below gives a glance at both my skills and academic background.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please feel free to contact me for my resume or any questions through any contact venues at the bottom.<br />
